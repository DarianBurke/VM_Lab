<h1>Virtual Machine Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates a simple virtual networking lab using two Windows 11 virtual machines configured in Oracle VirtualBox. The goal was to establish communication between the VMs using Host-Only networking (Adapter 2), allowing isolated network testing without external internet access.

During the setup, I encountered and resolved IP address configuration issues by using the netsh command-line tool to manually assign and troubleshoot network settings.

#### ðŸ”§ Languages and Utilities Used
- **Operating System:** Windows 11  
- **Virtualization Platform:** Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Command-Line Tools:** netsh, Command Prompt (CMD)  
- **Networking:** Host-Only Adapter configuration, IP addressing  

#### ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated
- Virtual network setup and configuration  
- Troubleshooting connectivity and IP issues  
- Using Windows networking commands for system management  
- Understanding of host-only and isolated network environments
